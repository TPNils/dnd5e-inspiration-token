# Inspiration token

An inspiration token, can be active and inactive.
When active the player can deactivate it to gain advantage on their next roll or reroll a certain D20 throw.

The token can be automatically reactivated by following situations:
- The player rolls a natural 1
- The DM rolls a natural 20

Alternatively, the DM can manually reactivate a token by:
- Giving that player disadvantage on a roll
- Giving the DM advantage against that player

When a rest is performed, if you have an active token, that active token will persist being active after the rest.
